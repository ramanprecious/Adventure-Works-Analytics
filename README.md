### Insights and Recommendations
The dashboards designed revealed a lot of insights, and these include:

1. More sales were recorded in the United States. This is a result of the huge online presence Adventure Works has in this country, which is its original location. More online marketing strategies should be employed to generate more orders.
2. Higher sales occurred in 2022, compared to 2021 and 2020. This could be a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or the introduction of new business development strategies. There is a need for the fine-tuning of current marketing strategies to improve optimization.
3. The bike product category generated more sales and profit. Mountain bike brands made the highest sales, while Road bike brands made the highest profit. More bikes should be added to the stock.
4. The target of 1.5 million dollars was exceeded.
5. A profit margin of 41% was recorded, showing that 2022 was a good year.
6. In Canada, there was an unusual spike in sales in August. The reason is unknown.
